# SQL Prepared Statements

## Overview

If your server uses a REST API and executes a lot of repetitive SQL queries, using prepared statements can significantly improve performance.

## How Prepared Statements Work

- A prepared statement is a SQL query that is compiled and stored for reuse.
- The database parses and plans the query only once, then reuses it multiple times with different parameters.
- This reduces the overhead of query parsing and planning for every request.

## Benefits of Prepared Statements

- **Performance Improvement**: Since SQL parsing and query planning are done only once, execution is faster.
- **Reduced Load on Database**: Reusing queries minimizes CPU usage for parsing and optimizing SQL.
- **Security**: Helps prevent SQL injection by separating query structure from data input.
- **Consistency**: Queries remain uniform, avoiding accidental SQL errors.

## Downsides of Prepared Statements

- **Increased Memory Usage**: The database needs to store prepared statements, consuming memory.
- **Less Flexibility**: Prepared statements are beneficial for repetitive queries but may not be ideal for dynamic queries with variable structure.
- **Connection Persistence**: Some databases require the same session/connection to reuse the prepared statement.

## Rails and Prepared Statements

- Rails uses prepared statements by default under the hood.
- It automatically prepares frequently executed queries to optimize performance.

## Example: Using Prepared Statements in SQL

```sql
PREPARE get_user (int) AS
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1;

EXECUTE get_user(42);
```

## Example: Using Prepared Statements in PostgreSQL with Node.js

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool();

(async () => {
    const client = await pool.connect();
    await client.query('PREPARE get_user AS SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1');
    const result = await client.query('EXECUTE get_user(42)');
    console.log(result.rows);
    client.release();
})();
```

## Conclusion

Prepared statements are a powerful tool to enhance SQL performance, especially in REST APIs with repetitive queries. However, they should be used judiciously, considering memory constraints and connection persistence requirements.
