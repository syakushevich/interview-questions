# Types of Locks in Relational Databases

Relational databases use several locking mechanisms to maintain data consistency and manage concurrent access. Here are some common types:

## 1. Table-Level Locks
- **Description:**
  Locks the entire table.
- **Usage:**
  Often used during bulk updates or schema changes.
- **Pros:**
  Simple and ensures no conflicting operations on any rows.
- **Cons:**
  Very coarse; it prevents any other transaction from accessing any part of the table, limiting concurrency.

## 2. Row-Level Locks
- **Description:**
  Locks individual rows that are being modified.
- **Usage:**
  Commonly used for update or delete operations where only specific rows are affected.
- **Pros:**
  Allows high concurrency as only the affected rows are locked.
- **Cons:**
  More overhead in managing many locks, especially when many rows are involved.

## 3. Page-Level Locks
- **Description:**
  Locks a fixed-size block (or page) of data, which can contain multiple rows.
- **Usage:**
  Balances between the granularity of row-level locks and the simplicity of table-level locks.
- **Pros:**
  Can reduce locking overhead when many rows in the same page are updated.
- **Cons:**
  May lock more rows than necessary, which can unnecessarily reduce concurrency.

## 4. Shared and Exclusive Locks
- **Shared Locks (S-locks):**
  - Allow multiple transactions to read the same data concurrently.
  - Prevent data modifications until all shared locks are released.
- **Exclusive Locks (X-locks):**
  - Only one transaction can hold an exclusive lock on a resource.
  - Blocks both reading and writing by other transactions.

## 5. Intent Locks
- **Description:**
  Used to signal the intention to acquire more granular locks (like row-level locks) later.
- **Usage:**
  Helps the database engine manage locking hierarchies and prevent conflicts between table-level and row-level locks.
- **Example:**
  An "intent exclusive" lock on a table indicates that a transaction intends to obtain exclusive locks on some rows within that table.

# Concurrency Control: Pessimistic vs. Optimistic Locking in Rails

## Pessimistic Locking

### Concept
Pessimistic Locking involves locking a record as soon as it is read for update, so that no other transaction can modify it until the lock is released.

### Implementation in Rails
Use ActiveRecord's `lock` method or `with_lock` block.

# Pessimistic and Optimistic Locking in Rails
```ruby
# Example using pessimistic locking:
user = User.lock.find(1)
user.update!(balance: user.balance - 100)
```

## Pessimistic Locking

### Overview
Pessimistic Locking involves locking a record as soon as it is read for update, ensuring that no other transaction can modify it until the lock is released. This guarantees immediate consistency during the update process.

### Pros
- **Immediate Consistency:**
  Prevents concurrent modifications, eliminating the risk of update conflicts.
- **Simplicity:**
  Once the lock is acquired, you can safely assume that no other transaction will interfere.

### Cons
- **Reduced Concurrency:**
  Locks held during long operations can block other transactions, potentially slowing down the system.
- **Deadlocks:**
  There is an increased risk of deadlocks if multiple transactions lock resources in different orders.

### When to Use
- **High Contention Scenarios:**
  Use when concurrent updates on the same data are very likely and conflicts must be avoided.
- **Critical Operations:**
  Use when the cost of data inconsistency is high and immediate consistency is crucial.


```ruby
# Example using optimistic locking:
user = User.find(1)
user.balance -= 100
user.save!  # Raises ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError if another update occurred
```
---

## Optimistic Locking

### Concept
Optimistic Locking assumes that conflicts are rare. Instead of locking data during the read phase, it relies on a version number (or timestamp) to detect if data has been modified before committing an update. If the version has changed, it indicates a conflict and an error is raised.

### Implementation Overview
- A version column (commonly named `lock_version`) is added to the model.
- The system checks the version before committing an update, and if it detects a change (indicating another transaction has modified the record), it raises an exception to signal the conflict.

### Pros
- **High Concurrency:**
  No locks are held during the reading phase, allowing many transactions to operate in parallel.
- **Efficient for Low Contention:**
  Best suited for applications where write conflicts are rare, which helps maximize throughput.

### Cons
- **Conflict Resolution:**
  When a conflict occurs, an exception is raised. This requires implementing retry logic or handling the conflict appropriately.
- **Not Ideal for High Contention:**
  In environments with frequent concurrent updates, the overhead of handling conflicts may outweigh the benefits of higher concurrency.

### When to Use
- **Low Contention Scenarios:**
  Ideal for applications with many reads and relatively few writes.
- **Performance-Sensitive Applications:**
  Suitable when maximizing throughput is more critical than preventing occasional update conflicts.

## Impact on Performance and Concurrency

### Pessimistic Locking
- **Performance:**
  Can decrease throughput because transactions must wait for locks to be released.
- **Concurrency:**
  Limits concurrent access, which may be acceptable in high-conflict situations where data integrity is paramount.

### Optimistic Locking
- **Performance:**
  Generally provides better throughput as it avoids locking during reads.
- **Concurrency:**
  Allows more simultaneous transactions but requires careful handling of conflict resolution when updates clash.

## Summary
Each locking strategy has its place. The choice between pessimistic and optimistic locking in Rails depends on your application's specific concurrency needs and the likelihood of conflicts in your data.
