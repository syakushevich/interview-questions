## Copy in SQL

## Overview

The `COPY` command is useful when inserting large amounts of data efficiently. It allows bulk data insertion and ensures that operations are atomicâ€”if a failure occurs in the middle, it rolls back the entire operation.

## Benefits of COPY

- **Bulk Insert Efficiency**: Faster than individual `INSERT` statements.
- **Transaction Safety**: If an error occurs, the operation is reverted.
- **Reduced Overhead**: Less parsing and planning compared to multiple `INSERT` statements.

## Example: Using COPY in SQL

```sql
COPY users (id, name, email) FROM '/path/to/file.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

## Example: Using COPY in Ruby on Rails (ActiveRecord)

```ruby
class BulkInsertUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def up
    execute "COPY users (id, name, email) FROM '/path/to/file.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;"
  end
end
```

## Conclusion

Indexes, partitioning, and bulk insertion using `COPY` are essential techniques for optimizing SQL database performance. Indexing speeds up queries, partitioning manages large datasets efficiently, and `COPY` significantly improves bulk data insertion while ensuring transaction safety.
