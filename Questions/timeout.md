# Investigating Timeout Errors in a Rails App

## 1. Identify the Scope of the Issue
- **Who is affected?** Only some users or all?
- **When does it happen?** During peak traffic or all the time?
- **Where does it happen?** Specific pages, endpoints, or actions?
- **Is it persistent or intermittent?** Does it happen on every request or randomly?

## 2. Check Logs for Errors & Slow Queries
### Rails Logs
Check the logs for timeout errors:
```bash
tail -f log/production.log | grep "timeout"
```
Look for:
- Controller & action where the timeout occurred.
- SQL queries and execution time.
- External API calls.

### Database Slow Queries
If the issue is database-related:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
```
or check logs:
```bash
tail -f log/postgresql.log | grep "duration:"
```
If using MySQL:
```sql
SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST;
```

## 3. Check Background Jobs & Queues
- **Delayed jobs or Sidekiq queue length:**  
  ```bash
  sidekiq -q
  ```
- If jobs are piling up, a queue might be blocking user requests.

## 4. Check External API Calls
If your app relies on external APIs:
- Identify if API calls are causing timeouts.
- Check for API rate limits.
- Add timeouts in your API requests:
  ```ruby
  HTTParty.get("https://example.com", timeout: 5)
  ```

## 5. Check Server Health & Performance
### CPU & Memory Usage
```bash
htop
free -m
```
If CPU is high, there might be a **slow query** or **high concurrent requests**.

### Check Web Server & Load Balancer
If using **NGINX/Puma/Unicorn**, check logs:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```
or:
```bash
journalctl -u puma
```

## 6. Review Configuration Settings
### Database Connection Pooling
If database connections are exhausted, increase the pool size in `database.yml`:
```yaml
production:
  pool: 20
```

### Increase Web Server Timeout
If using **Puma**, increase timeout in `config/puma.rb`:
```ruby
worker_timeout 60
```
If using **NGINX**:
```nginx
proxy_connect_timeout 60;
proxy_read_timeout 60;
```

### Increase Application Timeout
For Rails request timeouts (`config/application.rb`):
```ruby
config.middleware.insert_before Rack::Runtime, Rack::Timeout, service_timeout: 30
```

## 7. Use Performance Profiling Tools
- **rack-mini-profiler** (for analyzing slow requests)
- **New Relic / Skylight / Datadog** (monitoring performance)
- **ActiveRecord Query Analyzer** to find slow queries.

## 8. Replicate the Issue Locally
- Run the specific user flow that causes the timeout.
- Check if it's related to database queries, external API calls, or background jobs.
- Use `Rails.logger.debug` to add logs.

## 9. Mitigate While Debugging
- **Increase timeout temporarily** while debugging.
- **Optimize queries** if SQL is slow.
- **Add caching** to reduce expensive operations.
- **Scale the infrastructure** if the app is under high load.

## 10. Fix & Deploy
Once the root cause is found:
- Optimize the code (e.g., avoid N+1 queries).
- Adjust configurations (e.g., increase connection pool).
- Add **error handling** to prevent future issues.
