API Resilience and Fault Tolerance
Question:
How would you design an API service that our application depends on heavily, ensuring that if this API is turned off or becomes unavailable, the main application remains unaffected?
Follow-up Points:
What strategies or patterns (e.g., circuit breakers, graceful degradation, timeouts, retries, fallback mechanisms) can you use?
How would you isolate or decouple the API from the core system to prevent cascading failures?
